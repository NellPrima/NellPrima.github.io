                    when she was 18.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
                    This marriage was dissolved,and she later married actor Rex
                    Ingram. They divorced three years later in 1939. 
                    She studied and acted with the Federal Theater in Harlem,
                    which was sponsored by the Works Progress Administration.
                    <sup>[2]</sup> The Louisburg-born suffered extreme fear of 
                    flying in an airplane. She turned down several invitations 
                    to film festivals in Germany following this condition.
                    However , following her retirement from Harlem Hospital, 
                    She supported the black film entertainment industry. 
                    She was also part of the Negro Actors team and actively 
                    followed seminars sponsored by the International Agency 
                    for Minority Artists Affairs. Francine was also given the 
                    opportunity to lecture many upcoming  African-American 
                    actors.

                    movie industry at the time."
